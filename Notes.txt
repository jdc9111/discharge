The cool thing about this is that it's a "collapsing" form.  When printed it removes unnecssary or irrelevant text.

The 'Referral' box autocompletes.  Includes contact information to satisfy the CPSO requirement.

'Apt Date & Time' boxes are removed if there is no scheduled apt time.
'Meds to Start' and 'Meds to Stop' disappears if left blank.

'Standard instructions' can be text that is added to the "Special Instrucitons" when the form is printer OR a QR code.  You can edit "standard instructions" before printing.

Additional PDF handouts are added to the bottom of the "handout", but need to be printed separately (all you have to do is hit the 'print' button)

I need help with more "standard instructions".  Throw 'em at me.

I suggest printing 2 copies, one for the chart.
