The cool thing about this is that it's a "collapsing" form.  When printed it removes unnecssary or irrelevant text.

The 'Referral' box autocompletes.  Includes contact information to satisfy the CPSO requirement.

'Apt Date & Time' boxes are removed if there is no scheduled apt time.

'Standard instructions' can be text that is added to the "Special Instrucitons" when the form is printer OR a QR code.
